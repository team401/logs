# logs

Archive of logs from our robots for later analysis.

This repo is intended to serve as a storage place for our logs each season. Each season should have a branch, where logs from each competition for that season can be found in folders. For example, check out the `2025-logs` branch for logs from our 2025 competition season.

Some branches or folders may be incomplete: sometimes files are mistakenly deleted, data is lost, or uploads are forgotten.
